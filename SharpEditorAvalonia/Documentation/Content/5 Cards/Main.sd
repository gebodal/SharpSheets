# Cards

SharpSheets also allows you to generate cards based on configurations and subjects - how the cards look, and what content they have, respectively. Card configurations use a similar syntax to the standard SharpSheets configuration files, while the card subject files use a Markdown-inspired syntax.

Card configuration files can be saved into the Templates Directory, and then used by card subject files anywhere.

For a tutorial on writing card subject files, see [here](Cards/Subjects Tutorial).
