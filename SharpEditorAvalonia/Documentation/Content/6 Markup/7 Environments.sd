# Markup Environments

This page contains a complete list of the variables and functions available in the built-in Markup environment.

## Variables

Note that not all variables are available for all attributes. The canvas area and drawing area variables are only available to attributes which are calculated when such areas are known (there will be error messages in the event you attempt to access a variable you should not).

## Functions

In the below functions, a type of "any" means that the function accepts a variety of value types for this argument -- the function documentation may still list some restrictions on the input values, however.
